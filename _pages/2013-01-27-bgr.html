<img class="alignleft" title="BGR Screenshot" alt="BGR Screenshot" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/ryanharter-com-wordpress/images/screenshot_bgr.png" width="259" height="461" />The BGR app is a news reader for the popular mobile news site <a title="Boy Genius Report" href="http://bgr.com" target="_blank">Boy Genius Report</a>.  View, Share and Comment on articles right from your phone.

After having built an Android news reader for the Boy Genius Report because I was a reader, BGR contacted me about updating the app to match their new look.  We worked together over the next couple of weeks and were able to create a great experience for readers.

Check out the app at the <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.bgr" target="_blank">Play Store</a>.
