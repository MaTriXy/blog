My name is Ryan Harter.  I'm a 26 year old freelance Android developer from the midwest.  I've been developing mobile apps for Android and iOS for 4 years, professionally for 3.  After 2 and a half years developing enterprise apps for a mobile consulting firm, I decided to go out on my own to help people make great consumer apps.
<p style="text-align: left;">My passion isn't just making great apps, it's creating great experiences.  I'm the kind of developer that doesn't think about tasks, but about users.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">I'm always looking for new projects.  If you need an app built, shoot me an email.</p>
