My name is Ryan Harter.  I’m a 26 year old freelance Android developer from the midwest.  I’ve been developing mobile apps for Android and iOS for 4 years, professionally for 3.  After 2 and a half years developing enterprise apps for a mobile consulting firm, I decided to go out on my own to help people make great consumer apps.

My passion isn’t just making great apps, it’s creating great experiences.  I’m the kind of developer that doesn’t think about tasks, but about users.

I’m always looking for new projects.  If you need an app built, shoot me an email.
