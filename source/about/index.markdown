My name is Ryan.  I'm a **Freelance Android Developer** working with my own company, **Analog Ocean**.  I develop high quality Android apps that users love.  Don't believe me? Check out my own app [Hashnote](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.ryanharter.hashnote).

I earned my Bachelors degree in Computer Information Systems from the University of Wisconsin - Stevents Point.  All the while I worked for the university managing all of the Mac computers on campus and developing custom software for them.  In mid-2010 I packed up my belongings and moved to the Chicago suburbs to work as a mobile developer, specializing in iOS and Android.

Since then I've really focused on Android, serving as **Lead Android Developer** before I left the company to start freelancing.  Going independent is one of the best decisions I've made since it allows me to work on truly awesome apps that end users will love.  It also gives me time to work on my own projects, like Hashnote.

Other than that I'm a typical 27 year old.  I love traveling, music, longboarding and hanging out with my dogs.  I got married a year and a half ago and bought a house shortly after that.

I'm always looking for new projects and ideas.  If you have something in mind and need the help of an experienced Android develop, shoot me an email.
