I've been working with the guys at BGR for a couple of weeks now and have finally released the often requested official BGR app for Android.  They've written up a nice <a title="story" href="http://bgr.com/2012/11/13/bgr-android-app/" target="_blank">story</a> about the launch.

This app was an interesting development because several years ago I wrote a news reader app specifically tailored to BGR called Genius.  Genius was well received, with over 10,000 downloads, before I started talking with BGR about the sale of the app and future development.  For the official BGR app I did a complete rebranding to match their new look, updated much of the app to fit the new Android UI Guidelines, and improved the performance of the article loading.

BGR was a fun team to work with.  They had a look they wanted based on their iOS app, but were very open to suggestions regarding the UI allowing me to create a true Android experience that users will love.

Download the app from <a title="BGR" href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.bgr" target="_blank">Google Play</a>.
