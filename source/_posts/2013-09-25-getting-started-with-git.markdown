After installing Git, you need to do a few one time things.  These are system settings, so you only have to do them once.

``` sh
$ git config --global user.name "Your Name"
$ git config --global user.email your.email@example.com
```

Then you need to write some code:

``` java
public class MyClass {
	String object;
	private static final int CONSTANT = 1;
}
```
