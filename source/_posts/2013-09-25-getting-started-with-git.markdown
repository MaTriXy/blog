### What is SCM?



### Setting Up Git

The first step is to install Git. This can be done in several ways and depends on your system.  You can find out how to install Git for your system at the [Git](http://git-scm.com/) website.  

I use a Mac, and like to use [Homebrew](http://brew.sh/) to install command line programs.  You can do that with the following command:

``` sh
$ brew install git
```

### One Time Setup

After installing Git, you need to do a few one time tasks.  These are system settings, so you only have to do them once per machine.

First you need to set your name and email so git knows who you are.  This can seem rather unnecessary when you're working on a project alone, but in teams this is very helpful.

``` sh
$ git config --global user.name "Your Name"
$ git config --global user.email your.email@example.com
```
