Last week hosted the latest iteration of Google's annual developer conference, Google I/O.  Google I/O is where developers and enthusiasts go to get all of the latest news about Google's latest offerings, from Android to Chrome to their Cloud backend.

For the last two years, I was one of those developers that got to spend a few days a year with many other extremely brilliant people and learn a ton about new technologies.  Unfortunately, this year I, like many others, wasn't able to get a ticket.

I recently realized that part of the reason that I learned so much at Google I/O is that I had a few days where I didn't have to worry about anything else and got to absorb the sessions and really spend my time taking it all in.

<!-- more -->

With that in mind, I decided that I would make myself a lesson plan of sessions I would have attended and actually take the time to watch the videos of the sessions, follow along, and learn as much as I can.  Below you can see the sessions that I chose and, over time, what I've completed.

I'd encourage you to make your own plan and follow through with it.  If you've ever been to I/O you'll know that it's amazing what you can learn and how much you can improve by taking the time and focus to go through the sessions. Hopefully we'll all get tickets next year :)
