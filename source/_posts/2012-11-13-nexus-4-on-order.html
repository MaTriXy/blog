Google's latest flagship Nexus phone, the <a title="Nexus 4" href="http://www.google.com/nexus/4/" target="_blank">Nexus 4</a>, went on sale this morning.  After reading reports of the UK version selling out in less than an hour, and going through the Google I/O purchase process before, I kept refreshing that <a title="Nexus 4 (16GB)" href="https://play.google.com/store/devices/details?id=nexus_4_16gb" target="_blank">page</a>.  Some times it would load, sometimes it wouldn't.  Sometimes it would say "Add to Cart", sometimes it would say "Coming Soon".  After 15 minutes of teasing I was finally able to actually make it through the Google Wallet process and get one.

If you didn't get one yet, keep trying.  I thought I lost it quite a few times before my order finally went through.
