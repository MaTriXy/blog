<a href="http://www.ryanharter.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/feature_blog.png"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-160" alt="Hashnote" src="http://www.ryanharter.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/feature_blog.png" width="700" height="342" /></a>

It's only been three days since I launched <a title="Hashnote" href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.ryanharter.hashnote" target="_blank">Hashnote</a> for Android and I've gotten lots of great feedback.  Though the app is released and doing great, I don't plan on taking any breaks.  With that in mind, I've spent the time since Hashnote's release to develop a small update to include a <a title="DashClock" href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=net.nurik.roman.dashclock" target="_blank">DashClock</a> extension.  This lets you choose a hashtag, I use #remember, to be displayed in DashClock on your lock screen.  That way you have, at a glance, all of the things you need to remember.

It's making it's way through all of Google Play right now, but check it out as soon as it's available.
