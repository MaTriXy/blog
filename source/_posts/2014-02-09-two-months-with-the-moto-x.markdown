Two months ago, after an [unfortunate incident](http://www.ebay.com/itm/331089526837?ssPageName=STRK:MESOX:IT&_trksid=p3984.m1561.l2649) with my Nexus 5 and tile floor, I decided to hop off the Nexus train and get a Moto X.  After years of using nothing but Nexus devices (starting with the Nexus S) this was a bit switch that made me a little nervous.

Since I buy all of my phones off contract, it wasn't until Motorola offered a [Today Show special](http://www.theverge.com/google/2013/12/20/5230680/350-moto-x-is-back-thanks-to-the-today-show) that I was ready to drop the money.  As soon as I could get the phone for the price of a Nexus 5, I was sold.

## My Reasoning

I had always been a Nexus user because, as a developer, I felt that I needed a reference device that I could develop agains't without any of the manufacturer specific modifications that so many OEMs apply. 

Once the Moto X came along, we finally had a device on which the manufacturer was actually adding value to Android to help itself differentiate, instead of molesting it.  For the most part, the Moto X contains stock Android with extra [apps](http://www.motorola.com/us/Moto-X-Features-5---And-There%27s-More/motox-features-5-and-theres-more.html) and [services](http://www.motorola.com/us/Moto-X-Features-Touchless-Control/motox-features-2-touchless.html), instead of an entirely custom rom that changes the very foundation of Android.

Nexus phones had also been great for freedom from carriers.  Starting with the Nexus S, I have been buying my phones outright and using prepaid MVNO carriers to allow me the freedom to move between carriers (which I do about once per year) and upgrade my phone when I want.  Since I don't adhere to the usual two year carrier upgrade cycle, signing a contract didn't make a lot of sense.

## My Phone

My favorite feature of the Moto X by far isn't even really the phone itself.  If you purchase your Moto X directly from Motorola, you have the option to use [Moto Maker](https://www.motorola.com/us/motomaker?pid=FLEXR1#exterior/backplate), Motorola's web app to completely customize your phone.  This allows you to really make a phone that's truely unique to you.

Motorola has done a great job of choosing colors that go well together, in just about any combination.  I'm not artist, but I felt like I couldn't make a bad combination no matter which options I selected for back plate cover and accent color.

I eventually decided to go with a green back, blue accent colors and a white face.  Motorola even helps you share your design by giving you a link directly to [your design](https://www.motorola.com/us/motomaker?pid=FLEXR1&rear-color=OP100009&accent-color=OP100024&front-color=color-white&memory=optionMemory-16&wallpaper=82PA00000045&power=OP100034#exterior/backplate).

## Screen Quality

One of the things that I applauded Motorola for with the Moto X was the fact that they used a 720p screen while other manufacturers were touting their 1080p screens.  While more pixels are always cool, I felt it was a bit of over kill for a 4.5 inch screen.  I, honestly, couldn't really see much of a difference, and the tradeoff in battery life is well worth it.
